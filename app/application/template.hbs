  <p>Pick a category from the column to the left. A random word will be selected from the words in that collection.</p>
  <p>The goal of the game is to guess the letters in the randomly selected word. No need to worry about numbers or punctuation; those will be presented for you and can even help give you an idea of what the word may be.</p>
  <p>You will be presented with a gallows and a rope. For each wrong guess, a section of a stick figure will be drawn. There are six sections, therefore you get six guesses.</p>
